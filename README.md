# DriverApp

## Project Overview

**DriverApp** is a private internal mobile application developed for an FMCG company.  
This application is used to support daily delivery operations by drivers, helping them know which customers to deliver to based on scheduled routes and assigned areas. The application provides clear delivery information to ensure distribution runs on schedule and can be monitored properly. This application is intended for **internal use only** and is not publicly available.
